this assignment taught me how to hande cases in API and then identify issues like when we changed the name from joe to john and then switched the passwords for them to be the same. these things showed me how important it is to make sure the data is valid and when we put it into the system, that the user has a smooth experience. then seeing the tests helped me see how to make sure the code was and that it was helping with coverage. 

I also managed multiple issues and then finding the corresponding fixes helped me see how github workflows are and then tracking issues, branching, etc. this whole process helped me see how real world software projects are with maintining quality, coding issues, etc. i faced challenges like fixing issuees and input format and testing while changing schema. 

this project helped me develop development skills in backend, espcially in API schema, validation, and testing.
